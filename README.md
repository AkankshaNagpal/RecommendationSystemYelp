# Recommendation System for User and Business Establishment

Setting up a new business is an investment in terms of time as well as money. Many 
factors influence the success of the business, like the kind of business you want to setup, the 
location, the budget and the added services. Basically, the entrepreneurs focus on minimizing 
the risk factors. Demographics is one of the most important factors to consider when setting up 
the business. After all “You can’t do business in a brick and mortar store without the presence 
of customers, and proximity to customers is as elemental to a brick-and-mortar store as air, 
food and water are to each of us as human beings”. Population, customers’ interests, budget 
and thus business success rate changes based on the location. This project considers such 
factors influencing the business success and provides an application that entrepreneurs can 
utilize to decide the appropriate location and add-on services to the business to achieve 
success.
By applying different algorithms for each use case, this project provides the users with 
“
the varied recommendations systems depending upon the categories they choose. Consider a 
use case where a business owner wants to establish a new Indian Restaurant. For this, he will 
first need to analyze appropriate location where people tend to eat out and then analyze what 
other services they appreciate. Another example would be to open a real estate business which 
will be most profitable if owner decides to set up near some school as there would be lot of 
international students looking for housing facilities. Similarly a healthcare center might be more successful if they provide facility on weekends or late nights. These all use cases consider the
recommendation model as a base for coming up with the final decision.”
Promotions, people, places, and prices are the elements that make a business more 
“
strategic in terms of management. Promotion refers to marketing about the products or to sell 
the products or services. Promotion is to promote your business or products. People refer to 
users of the products/services or the customers. Prize refers to the amount you charge for your 
products or services. Lean startup is all about this methodology. It does not make sense to start 
a business that is not in demand. To understand the customer needs, to hit the right crowd, to 
decide upon the correct location for your business are very important and is one of the 
smartest way to do business. The project is based on making such smart recommendations that 
help you decide what is needed to start your business.”
Various data mining techniques such as clustering and predictive analysis are used for 
“
analyzing the demographic data like user reviews, ratings, and location-based data for a 
business. This analysis is then used to make content-based as well as collaborative-based 
recommendation.
